two expamples at the start when they talked about wipers being
used to shorten the coil and thats how nobs work, and much
farther into it like page 200 after explaining how gauges are
made its dedicated like one page but phone cameras using the

All the articles are from a year ago so im pretty sure Darcula isn't around anymore. I am interested in model safety you can cheat on a test but the model will stop if it sees that its on respondus or something or you can be researching hacking stuff like darcula and it will have a hard cut off now you can say im just a researcher but still no instructions.

I have traveled to some really amazing places for this im imagining being on top of Whistler Mountain. And again I try to put myself in the headspace isn't this awesome its so cool, but idk in the moment its just there infront of me and kind of boring yet I remeber them for years.
