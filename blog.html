I am interested in model safety you can cheat on a test but the model will stop if it sees that its on respondus or something or you can be researching hacking stuff like darcula and it will have a hard cut off now you can say im just a researcher but still no instructions.

Meta thoughts, David Foster Wallace talks about them. A fundamentally good story can grasp at them, but they also make the story either really good or just hollow.

          This movie also holds scenes so long that your mind can wander and even get to second-order thinking while watching the film. That can't really happen in a Christopher Nolan film like Tenet.

          The ending, what did I think of it? I think I can say the core concepts are our tools shaping us and human ingenuity, and it is cautious with all three technologies or they become bad in the story, even though the tool itself is neutral.

          So the bone is used for bad. HAL, who I would like to think is conscious, fears for himself, so he becomes defensive and bad. Now the obelisk, I would like to equate it with the aliens from Arrival. It gives him the technology to leave time, basically.

          I don't know. The point is that I can put a lot of things onto it, and there is maybe one truth. Donnie Darko does this as well. A metaphysical thought is something you have to think about more. It has to be circled around and maybe shown slant or indirectly. Those are the best.`,

I don't think that can be a real daily thing. In fact, I get a profound despair any time I go on a real vacation longer than a week.

          My skill wouldn't be jazz. It would be projects. I'm sadly not a robotics guy, but Michael Reeves, Stuff Made Here, Code Bullet. Projects like that with people, while also getting to have a free life, and also getting to read and watch movies all the time, that would be the perfect life, I think.

          Tom wasn't boring, but I think Dickie is the real main character. People do have to react to him. I think Tom killing the guy right at the end did kind of ruin his character, like Nolan keeping conquest at the end. It just makes them more evil for not much reason.`,
